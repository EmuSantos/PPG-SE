📄 Description
The Pico y Placa Generator - TAXI Edition is a Python application that automates the creation of vehicle restriction metadata specifically for taxis in Environmental Zones (EZ).

This tool uses Streamlit as a web interface to:

  Allow manual input of taxi plate numbers by day.
  Select custom date ranges and exclude holidays.
  Group dates into consecutive weekly blocks, even if weeks are incomplete.
  Dynamically select EZ_Tag values (LicensePlate, LicensePlateEnding, or LicensePlateStarting).
  Export the results as a CSV file for further processing.
🚀 Features
✅ Dynamic Date Range Selection:
Specify a custom start and end date.
Exclude holidays by entering them manually.

✅ Flexible Plate Input:
Manually enter taxi plate numbers per day.
Grouped by consecutive weekly blocks.

✅ Dynamic EZ_Tag Selection:
Choose between:
  LicensePlate → EZ_KEY_ID = 3
  LicensePlateEnding → EZ_KEY_ID = 5
  LicensePlateStarting → EZ_KEY_ID = 7
The EZ_KEY_ID is dynamically updated based on the selection.

✅ Export to CSV:
Generates a structured DataFrame with all restriction records.
Exports the data to a CSV file for easy integration with other systems.

🚩 Troubleshooting
Streamlit not found:
Make sure Streamlit is installed:
    pip install streamlit

CSV encoding issues:
  Ensure you export using UTF-8 encoding.

Modify the CSV export line if needed:
  csv = df.to_csv(index=False, encoding='utf-8').encode('utf-8')

💡 Future Improvements
✅ Add support for additional vehicle categories.
✅ Implement multi-language support (English/Spanish).
✅ Include validation checks for invalid plate formats.
