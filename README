  📄 Description
  Pico y Placa Generator Special Edition is a Python-based tool designed to automate the creation 
of metadata for vehicle restriction zones, commonly known as “Pico y Placa”, for this edition gives 
the coder the option to specify the restriction on a day-by-day basis based on the information collected.  
This tool simplifies the process by providing a graphical interface through Streamlit, allowing users to 
easily configure and generate restriction records without modifying the code. The tool exports the final 
data as a CSV file, which can be integrated into external vehicle control and monitoring systems.


🚀 Features
✅ User-friendly interface: Built with Streamlit for easy interaction.
✅ Flexible restriction settings: Configure vehicle categories, date ranges, and restriction values.
✅ Truck-specific restrictions: Option to add weight-based restrictions only when needed.
✅ Holiday handling: Exclude holidays from the restriction periods.
✅ Data export: Export the generated metadata to CSV format.
✅ Duplicate prevention: Ensures no duplicate records are generated.
✅ Open-source: Easily customizable for specific needs.
